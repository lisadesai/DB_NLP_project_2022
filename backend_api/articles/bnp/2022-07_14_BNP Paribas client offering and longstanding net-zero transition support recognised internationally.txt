“True sustainable finance requires
profound transformations, to
which we have aspired since several years. In addition to our commitments to society and to our clients, we
need to ensure that we have robust data enabling every ESG element of our
proposed transformation to rely on a very real and robust process. A lot
remains to be done but being awarded both Best Bank for Sustainable Finance and
Best Bank for ESG Data shows that we are heading in the right direction.”

Head
of Company Engagement for BNP Paribas and Member of the Group Executive
Committee 












Extra financial reporting for a responsible approachThis longstanding strategy is being accelerated by the new strategic plan, the GTS (Growth, Technology and Sustainability) 2025. Serving as a compass for aligning its portfolio towards a net-zero economy, this year Group BNP Paribas unveiled its first Climate analytics and alignment report and announced carbon intensity reduction targets by 2025.  In line with this announcement, BNP Paribas Asset Management published its 2021 Sustainability Report detailing it’s responsible approach.
