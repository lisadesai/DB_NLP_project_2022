# DB NLP Project 2022

The purpose of this project was to analyze the environmental, social and governance (ESG) efforts of Deutsche Bank as compared to other banks such as BNP and Citi to deliver future actionable recommendations for the bank.

This was done by creating a Flask app using Google's **natural language processing** (NLP) APIs to build and call our own endpoints to perform sentiment analysis, keyword analysis, content classification, and topic analysis on a collection of ESG articles for all three banks.


## Stack:
- Front end: Plotly Dash
- Back end: Python Flask app hosted on Google Cloud with NoSQL database (Google's Datastore)
